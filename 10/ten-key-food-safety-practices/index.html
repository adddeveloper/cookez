    <h1 id="ttitle">Ten Key Food Safety Practices</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h2>Clean Hands and Surfaces</h2>
			<p>Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling food, and after using the bathroom, handling pets, or changing diapers. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and seafood, and wash all cutting boards, utensils, and surfaces with hot, soapy water after each use.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Cook Foods to Proper Temperatures</h2>
			<p>Use a food thermometer to ensure that meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs are cooked to a safe internal temperature. Cook ground beef to at least 160°F, poultry to at least 165°F, and seafood to at least 145°F. Reheat leftovers to at least 165°F.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Avoid Cross-Contamination</h2>
			<p>Keep raw meat, poultry, and seafood separate from other foods in your grocery cart, refrigerator, and during food preparation. Use separate cutting boards, utensils, and dishes for raw and cooked foods.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Refrigerate Promptly</h2>
			<p>Refrigerate perishable foods, such as meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy products, within two hours of cooking or purchasing. Keep your refrigerator at 40°F or below and your freezer at 0°F or below.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Use Safe Water and Raw Materials</h2>
			<p>Use safe, clean water for drinking, cooking, and washing. Choose fresh, unspoiled ingredients and avoid using ingredients that are past their expiration date or that have an unusual odor or appearance.</p>

        <li>
            <h2>Store Foods Properly</h2>
            <p>Store foods at the proper temperature and in the proper location. Keep raw meat, poultry, and seafood in a separate, sealed container on the bottom shelf of your refrigerator. Keep canned goods in a cool, dry place and do not use cans that are dented, swollen, or corroded.</p>

        <li>
			<h2>Be Aware of Foodborne Illness Symptoms</h2>
			<p>Be aware of the symptoms of foodborne illness, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Seek medical attention if you experience these symptoms after consuming food, especially if you are in a high-risk group such as pregnant women, young children, older adults, or individuals with weakened immune systems.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Use Safe Cooking Methods</h2>
			<p>Use safe cooking methods, such as boiling, steaming, baking, and roasting, to cook food thoroughly and kill harmful bacteria. Avoid consuming raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Practice Safe Food Handling Outside the Home</h2>
			<p>When eating out, choose restaurants that practice safe food handling and preparation methods. If you have leftovers, refrigerate them promptly and reheat them to a safe temperature before consuming.</p>

			<h2>Be Mindful of High-Risk Foods</h2>
			<p>Be mindful of high-risk foods that are more likely to cause foodborne illness, such as raw or undercooked eggs, raw or undercooked meat and poultry, raw or undercooked seafood, unpasteurized dairy products, and fresh produce that has not been washed properly.</p>
